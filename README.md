Project Description:
This project focuses on scraping data from the Indian Premier League (IPL) Auction, extracting detailed information about players, franchises, and bids. The goal is to clean, organize, and store the data in a structured format (CSV), which can then be used for further analysis.

The dataset includes player names, franchises, roles, and the corresponding bid amounts. The project utilizes web scraping techniques to gather the data, which is then written into a CSV file for potential analysis in fields like team composition, franchise spending patterns, and player valuations.

Project Structure:
Web Scraping: Extracted player data such as player names, franchises, roles, and bid amounts from the IPL auction webpage.
Data Cleaning: Parsed and formatted the extracted data into a structured CSV file for further use.
Data Analysis: Set up basic exploration to identify trends such as top franchises by spending, player categories by price, and role-based auction dynamics.
Result:
The project successfully gathered and saved IPL auction data into a CSV file named ipl_auction_data_2024.csv. This data can be used for various analysis tasks like franchise spending patterns, player role distribution, and comparison of players' valuations.

Future Work:
Extend the project to analyze data over multiple IPL seasons.
Perform in-depth statistical analysis and visualization on auction trends.
Implement machine learning models to predict future player auction prices based on historical data.
